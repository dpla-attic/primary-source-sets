What do the sources tell us about England's reason for fighting. Are the sources biased?\n * Use the <a href='http://dp.la/primarysourceset/source/8af90d3a1a85936681a7d8bd156f6a3'>account of speeches and treaties</a> to learn about the Native American perspective on the war. Why did they fight? What did they hope to win?\n * Use the <a href='http://dp.la/primarysourceset/source/87037c8c0dc514bfd19bddbce9ff2ce7'>letter at the end of George Washington's diary</a> and the <a href='14e1f06f68b9f954a1936424d29673ea'>map</a> to learn about the French perspective on the war. Why did they fight? What did they hope to win?\n\n * Analyze the <a href='http://dp.la/priarysourceset/source/684ba704a6cafcab5203490eac01aaa1'>medal commemorating the capture of Montreal</a>. What symbols appear on the medal? What do they represent? Do we use similar symbols today?\n##Activity:\n Divide the class into three groups: Native Americans, French, and British. Have each group read the primary sources relevant to their assigned role, and discuss their perspective on the war. What did they stand to gain? Why did they fight? Moderate a debate between the three groups based on the positions they hold. Have the class vote on the winner of the debate. Then lead a discussion on the actual outcomes of the war. Did the \"correct\" side win?"
