These sets were created and reviewed by the teachers on the DPLA's <%= link_to 'Education Advisory Committee', wordpress_path('education/education-advisory-committee') %>. We will be adding new sets and features through Spring 2016. Read about our <%= link_to 'education projects', wordpress_path('education') %> and contact us with feedback at <%= mail_to Settings.contact_email, Settings.contact_email %>.</p>
